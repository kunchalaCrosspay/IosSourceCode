They explain many of your responsibilities to us and our responsibilities to you, how and when each Contract and these Terms can be terminated and the extent of our liability to you. If there are any terms that you do not understand or do not wish to agree to, please contact us. You should only complete the sign-on procedures and agree to the Terms and enter into Contracts if you agree to be bound by these Terms.<br><br>

If a supported payment method is being used by you for a transaction, you authorize Crosspay and its merchant service provider to store the payment credentials for future scheduled or unscheduled transactions. By using a payment method to perform transactions through with the services, you represent and warrant to us that you are authorized to use such payment method with the Services, and that any transactions made using such payment method are for lawful purposes only.<br><br>

Please keep your payment method information current (i.e. credit card number and expiration date). If this information changes, we may automatically update it as directed by your bank or card issuer without any action on your part, and we will use such updated payment method information with any existing recurring payment or other payment authorization. To verify that a stored or linked method of payment is valid and authorized, we may periodically prompt you to confirm additional cardholder data such as billing post code or card verification value (CVV). Card details are stored by our merchant services provider.<br> <br>

You can select a preferred payment method after logging into your individual account, navigating to the payment methods menu option and selecting the star next to your preferred payment method. If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment when you make payments. There may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that has expired or your bank account has insufficient funds. Also, the availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular Organisation you are using. We may also restrict the types of payment methods you can use or accept through the Services at any time in our sole discretion. If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable or declined, we may select among any of the active payment methods in your individual account.<br><br>
                    
                    2.6 <b>Fees for Individuals - </b> Crosspay does not charge Individuals processing or other fees for making donations, unless the donor elects to help cover processing fees incurred by an Organisation by voluntarily contributing more. For other types of payments, Crosspay may charge convenience, service, and/or other processing fees to you for making payments. Your financial institution(s) may also charge fees for processing your payment and/or if you have insufficient funds to cover a payment, and/or for currency conversions.

                    2.6 <b>Currency  - </b> Payments are processed using the Organisation’s local currency (e.g., for UK Organisations, payments are processed in GBP). If you utilize a different form of currency from that of an Organisation (e.g., the account you make a payment from is in USD and the Organisation located in the UK only accepts GBP), payment would be processed in the Organisations form of currency (e.g., GBP in the immediately preceding example) and you (as an Individual) may incur additional fees, which will be charged to your selected payment method.<br><br>
                    
                    2.6 <b>Responsibility for Unauthorized Payments and Errors  - </b> Where an Error occurs (as defined below), we will endeavour to rectify the Error if we determine it is solely our fault<br><br>
